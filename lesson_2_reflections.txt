What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git initiated in the directory. then I need to track files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is just a middl area between working directory and repository. Not all files in working area are in staging area. and repository is the final destination from staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
run git diff command to check code before committing it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
adding features, release, fix bugs, â€¦
