When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when working in a team or more than one computer. I even like to do this when I'm working solo on a project with a single pc because it makes me sure.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because it’s better under control and you won’t face with unwanted errors during writing code due to changes in other parts of code.
