How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

If the previous version worked, then we can check what has changed since then and find errors like typos more easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

We have an unlimited undo options :)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros: having meaningful commits.
cons: forgetting/ ignoring necessary commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because Google docs and similar are not designed for tracking multiple related file changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

command git log shows all changes and git diff just compares two versions together.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Itâ€™s much easier because we can revert it back with just a checkout command.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

now, just for projects of this course. However I like to use it for everything.
